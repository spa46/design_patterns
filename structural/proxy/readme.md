# Proxy Pattern

## Definition
Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. 
A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

There are 3 kinds of proxies(ref. [Here](https://brownbears.tistory.com/551) (Korean)):
- virtual proxy
- protection proxy
- remote proxy
