# Composite Pattern

## Definition
partitioning design pattern. 
It describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. 
The intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
It allows you to have a tree structure and ask each node in the tree structure to perform a task.
